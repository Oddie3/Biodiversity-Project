# Biodiversity-Project

This project analyzes biodiversity data from national parks, focusing on the conservation status of species and their observations in different parks. The aim is to explore the distribution of species, identify endangered species, and assess their observations across parks.

## Project Structure

- **biodiversity.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and results.
- **species_info.csv**: Dataset with details about species, including category, scientific name, common names, and conservation status.
- **observations.csv**: Dataset with information about species observations in national parks.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean species and observation data.
   - Handle missing values in conservation status.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Distribution of conservation status across species categories.
   - Proportion of species with unknown conservation status.
   - Endangered species analysis by park.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Pie charts to show conservation status distribution for different categories.
   - Observations of endangered species by park.

4. **Insights**:
   - Frequently observed endangered species.
   - Most observed species by conservation status.

## Key Findings

- Four parks (Bryce, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Great Smoky Mountains) have an equal number of endangered species.
- The gray wolf (*Canis lupus*) is frequently observed, with the highest number of observations in Yellowstone National Park.
- The species *Myotis lucifugus* is a "Species of Concern" with significant observations.
